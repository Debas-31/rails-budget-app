# Rails Budget App
> A Ruby on Rails capstone project about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated     with a category so that you can see how much money you spent and on what, and that allows the user to:
  - Register and log in so that the data is private to them.
  - Introduce new transactions associated with a category.
  - See the money spent on each category.
