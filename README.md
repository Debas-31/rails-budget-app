# Rails Budget App
> A Ruby on Rails capstone project about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category so that you can see how much money you spent and on what, and that allows the user to:
 - Register and log in so that the data is private to them.
 - Introduce new transactions associated with a category.
 - See the money spent on each category.
